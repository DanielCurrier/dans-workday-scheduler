# Description
This program is an assessment of my knowledge reagrding third party apis such as Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js  by creating a workday scheduler app that has a dynamic layout based on the current timeframe. PLease refer to the instructions section for more info!
## Installation

## Instructions
To use this program, click on this link to the deployed application:. Once you have reached the page, you will see today's date, along with a series of rows below it. Below is a reference image that you can use as a visual aid:

Rows that are grayed out indicate that this hour has past, if it is colored in red  it is the current hour , and any row in green is in the future. Click on any of the rows to start typing in any task you wish to complete during that hour, and then click on the save icon on the right side of that row to save it to local storage. 
 
If you want to use this again, but the previous day's notes are still on the screen, hit the clear fields  button above the date to delete those notes. Use chrome DevTools to inspect the page to see what is under the hood!
